# Ethics of the Plant Care Guide dataset
## Purpose of data collection
I am collecting this data for two main reasons:
1. For educational purposes - I need to do a class project that involves webscraping
2. I am interested in plants, but I don't really know how to take care of most house plants, so I wanted to
   create a dataset that would tell me how to take care of a lot of common ones. The code webscrapes only the plant
   name and care information for each plant. 

## Data sources and robots.txt
This site does not have API access or documentation, which makes it interesting to scrape. General access for 
most of the pages, including the common house plants page, is allowed according to the robots.txt file.

## Collection practices
I have only done scraping on one main section of the website (common houseplants) to avoid major disruption to the wesite. 
There are no password protections I have bypassed, and I have added a rest section of code so as to not 
disrupt the server too much.

## Data handling and privacy
There is no confidential data within the file; it is only data publicly accessible to everyone looking at the website.

## Data usage
This data will only be used for educational purposes (for a class project), and not for any other reason, monetary or otherwise.
